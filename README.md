# eds221_scientific_programming_essentials

These are the daily assignments and labs from my Masters of Environmental Data Science course, EDS 221: Scientific Programming Essentials. 

Originally, these assignments each had their own repository because I was getting comfortable using Git controlled R projects at the time I made them. FOr the sake of decluttering my GitHub, I am condensing the assignments into 1 repository.
